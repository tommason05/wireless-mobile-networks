# Coursework 1 â€“ Home Wireless Network Design

This project demonstrates the planning, design, and configuration of a secure home wireless network built in **Cisco Packet Tracer** for a three-bedroom student house.  
It includes network setup, VLAN segmentation, ACL security, DHCP configuration, and performance testing.
